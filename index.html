                    A styleguide clearly demonstrates how all interface elements and components are to be visually
                    represented.
                    It’s essentially a master reference for the user interface (UI).

                <h1>Why Sicpa needs a styleguide?</h1>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>
                    A lot of designers and creatives overlook the need for a brand styleguide (also called a brand bible
                    by
                    some) — something that gives a clear set of rules for how our projects should look.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                Styleguides can save us time, money, and tons of frustration down the road, making our projects easier
                to
                maintain and create. Consider it like an extension of well-commented markup, it gives you instructions
                for
                exactly how things should be done, and sometimes even insight into why.
            </section>

            <section>
                Styleguide will provide a way to better communicate the UI identity to our team and our final client.
            </section>

            <section>
                Styleguide make it very clear for a developer to pick up and begin building components.
            </section>

            <section>
                If I were to update a button element by changing its markup or CSS, that change would be reflected
                instantly
                on the website or app.

                <h3>DRY (don't repeat yourself)</h3>
            </section>

                <ul>
                    <li>Staying organized</li>
                    <li>Code maintainability</li>
                    <li>Fewer bugs</li>
                    <li>Whether it's a new feature, performance improvement, or bug fix we write the code for one
                        project
                        (core styleguide), and the DRY benefits go to all of them

                <p>All components are designed with extensibility and adaptivity in mind, the sicpa colors/design
                    way

            <section>
                <h3>Consistency</h3>
            </section>
            <section>
                Consistency is the main reason to use a styleguide. You want all the copy that comes out of your office
                to
                reinforce your brand in a specific, thought-out way. Inconsistencies distract the reader, and make your
                company look a bit careless.

                A styleguide also helps you be professional – to ensure every word you use is thoughtful, considered,
                and
                properly punctuated. And it makes life easier for your writers.

            <section>
                If we need to update the markup of a component, and this component exists in the front end style guide
                and
                on the website, as entirely separate pieces of code, we are creating more work for ourselves. As a
                result
                the front end style guide might be neglected, not being updated as it should be and fall into disrepair.
            </section>

            <section>
                Using a styleguide helps better communicate the interface identity and UX to others. The developer may
                know
                why a certain colour is used for certain button actions, but that isn’t much good if no one else knows
                why.
                Having a styleguide helps others to have a better understanding of the UI.
            </section>

            <section>
                Styleguide give us the following benefits:

                <ul>
                    <li>Encourages designers to think about the interface as an organic, scalable and flexible system.
                    </li>
                    <li>Encourages consistency in the visual identity and helps keep the interface taxonomy/system as
                        logical as possible, leading to a better UX.
                    </li>
                    <li>Makes designing interfaces more methodical and component based.</li>
                    <li>Helps to quickly communicate the interface identity to other people on the team or to your
                        clients.
                    </li>
                    <li>Gives us an holistic view and makes it easy to spot any incongruous interface elements.</li>
                    <li>Makes it very clear for a developer to pick up and begin building.</li>
                    <li>Beneficial for clients, both as a project deliverable and as stream of communication.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                A styleguide might seem unnecessary for a small company, or when there’s only one designer. But really,
                every brand out there should have a style and branding guide to make sure that every visual element they
                produce is consistent.
            </section>

            <section>
                Let’s take the one designer/developer idea first. So you’re the lone designer/developer on a project for
                your company. You design their logo, website, business cards, and every other bit of marketing material
                they
                need. You know all of the elements by heart.
            </section>

            <section>
                Now, a year later the company has tripled in size, and suddenly they need to hire a second designer to
                handle some of your workload. You get the fun of teaching this new person all of the guidelines for the
                brand from memory. Including a lot of things you haven’t even thought of in the past year.
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>
                    It would be infinitely easier if we could simply hand over a styleguide that contains everything
                    they
                    need to know: colors, logo sizes and placement, fonts used, components ... etc.
                </p>

                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                Styleguides can also help ensure that work done isn’t ruined by some new, less-experienced developers
                who
                doesn’t understand how the design is supposed to work.
